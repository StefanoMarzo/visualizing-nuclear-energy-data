# Nuclear Energy Data visualization

### A due premise
Effectively analysing the causes of CO2 production is an extremely onerous task as there are many
variables to consider e.g., history and politics, cultural and social development, presence of combustibles resources in the territory etc. This premise is meant to clarify the purpose of the analysis
conducted, which consists of a data reading that raises some interesting considerations. The results
obtained are therefore to be interpreted as an objective read-out of the data, which is not intended
to provide any generalized scientific consideration.

### Visualizing nuclear energy data
Gross domestic product (GDP) is considered to be an accurate indicator of the economic development of a given country or region. 
Along with the socioeconomic growth of countries, CO2 emissions are also shown to increase. While technologies for producing renewable energy advance, the use of nuclear fuels could be considered a convenient alternative way to decelerate emissions of
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Given this consideration, a question arise: is it possible to find
a relation between the adoption of nuclear energy and the reduction of the carbon footprint? Public
data regarding sixty years of economic development, energy management and CO2 emissions have
been taken into account to provide an analytical interpretation of some major aspects of the global
carbon dioxide dispersion. Data show that most of the countries that have drastically reduced CO2
emissions are also nuclear power producers, and that in some cases the decrease of emissions follows
an increase in the share of nuclear power production in a given country.

### What data say?
It is possible to show how the global income grows together with CO2 emissions. Correlation between normalized global GDP and CO2 total emissions demonstrates a high level of
interrelation between the trends.

The results demonstrate a clear relation between the data, and show that GDP and CO2
emissions are in average rising in the years considered. This led to investigate on countries
which are not following the trend and hence reducing CO2 emissions. The top ten countries
for emissions reduction have been displayed and presented in a bar chart in Fig. 2, the years
reported near to each bar represent the year of highest CO2 emissions and the negative
numbers in the bars are the difference of emissions from the year of the highest production
to 2010.

The bar chart in Fig. 2 shows that among the best countries for CO2 reduction, the 80%
of them are nuclear energy producers. Moreover, as reported in (Nuclear Energy Institute,
2018), the 60% of the countries displayed are in the list of top countries for nuclear energy
production and 40% of them are among the top countries for nuclear energy share.
Lastly, the top four countries for CO2 reduction among nuclear producers has been considered. Of these countries, a relationship between emissions reduction and a gradual increase in the share of nuclear power was investigated. The results are shown in Fig. 3.

It is possible to see that for Ukraine, Germany and France, a larger share of nuclear energy
led to a CO2 emissions reduction, while the United Kingdom does not show evidence of correlation. This graph is not to be intended as a clear evidence of the fact the nuclear energy
can reduce CO2 emissions value. Indeed, as stated in the premise, comprehending the factors to be considered for a deep and scientific understanding of CO2 emissions causation is
not among the aims of this analysis.
